üè® Hotel Management System
A comprehensive, desktop-based Hotel Management System built with Java Swing and MySQL. This application provides a complete graphical user interface for managing all key hotel operations, from customer check-in and room allocation to employee management and checkout processes.

üìã Project Overview
Welcome to the Hotel Management System ‚Äì a robust and user-friendly desktop application designed to streamline the complex operations of a modern hotel. Developed entirely in Java using the Swing framework for the GUI, this project demonstrates a practical application of object-oriented programming and database management.

The system is designed with a clear separation of roles, providing distinct functionalities for general reception tasks and administrative duties. From a centralized dashboard, users can navigate through various modules to manage customers, rooms, employees, and more. The intuitive interface ensures that staff can perform their daily tasks efficiently, reducing manual errors and improving overall service quality.

Key highlights of the project include:

Intuitive GUI: A clean and easy-to-navigate graphical user interface built with Java Swing.

Database Integration: All data is persistently stored and managed in a MySQL database.

Modular Design: The application is broken down into logical modules for different hotel operations (Reception, Admin, etc.).

Real-world Functionality: Simulates the core processes of a real hotel, making it a great portfolio piece.

Whether you're a student learning Java, a developer looking for a comprehensive project example, or a hotel looking for a foundational management system, this project offers valuable insights and practical solutions.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

An IDE that supports Java Swing projects (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

MySQL Server installed and running

Installation
Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Hotel-Management-System.git](https://github.com/your-username/Hotel-Management-System.git)

Set Up the Database

Start your MySQL server.

Create a new database with the name hotelmanagementsystem.

Create the required tables: login, employee, customer, room, driver, and department. The table structures can be inferred from the SQL queries within the Java source files.

Configure the Database Connection

Open the Conn.java file located in src/hotel/management/system/.

IMPORTANT: Update the database connection string with your MySQL username and password.

// Inside the Conn() constructor
c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotelmanagementsystem", "your-username", "your-password");

Run the Application

Open the project in your IDE.

Locate and run the HotelManagementSystem.java file to start the application.

‚öôÔ∏è How To Use
Login: Launch the application. You'll be greeted by the login screen. Use the credentials from your login table in the database to log in. [cite: Hotel Management System/src/hotel/management/system/Login.java]

Dashboard: After a successful login, the main dashboard appears, giving you access to the "Hotel Management" and "Admin" sections. [cite: Hotel Management System/src/hotel/management/system/Dashboad.java]

Admin Panel: Use the "Admin" menu to add new employees, rooms, and drivers. This is for managing the hotel's resources.

Reception Desk: Access the "Reception" from the "Hotel Management" menu. This is the main hub for daily operations, including customer check-ins, viewing room status, managing checkouts, and more. [cite: Hotel Management System/src/hotel/management/system/Reception.java]
